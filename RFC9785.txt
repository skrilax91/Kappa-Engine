RFC 9785
R-Type Protocol

                            1.  INTRODUCTION

   The aims of the project is to recreate the R-Type game with implementation 
   of a multithreaded server and a graphical client.

                        2.  R-TYPE PRESENTATION

   The R-Type works with a client-server architecture.
   The game uses both the server and the client, but with the server having 
   authority over the client.
   The client connects to the server using the R-Type protocol and once 
   connected can play the game.
   The server implements all the game logic.
   The client is the display terminal of the game.


                          3.  R-TYPE PROTOCOL

   Our protocol is a TCP protocol and will allow the player to be redirected to
   an available server in order to join a game. If there is no game available, 
   then there is no server to connect to and a new server will be started to
   create a new game. 

   In order to connect to the server, we have put in validation steps. There 
   is a kind of "captcha" to fill in to validate the authorization of the 
   communication with the server to be sure that the program can work with it.

   To connect, the client does a get server and the server responds with an 
   address and port which are the connection information. 

   Once this is done, the client can connect to the server.

                                                                [Page 1]
